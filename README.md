# Hi, I'm Irene Cazaux 👋🏼
I'm a UX/UI Designer based in Edinburgh, UK.

My professional journey began as a graphic designer. Immerse in the realm of visuals, I breathed life into brands and effectively communicated their essence through my designs. As my career unfolded, I ventured beyond borders, finding myself in the creative landscapes of Germany and the United Kingdom.

During my time as a graphic designer, I had a profound realization: I yearned to create meaningful impacts on users' lives. This awakening ignited my passion for exploring the captivating realm of User Experience (UX) design. Driven by my autodidactic nature, I eagerly absorbed knowledge about human behavior, psychology, and problem-solving, allowing me to transition into a dynamic UX Designer. Now, I possess the ability to craft simple and meaningful user experiences.

Throughout my professional journey as a UX Designer, I have thrived in B2B business environments where collaboration and teamwork have become integral parts of my creative process. Working alongside other teams within the organization, I find immense joy in the collaborative processes that lead to innovative solutions.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I embrace an active social life, seeking inspiration from cinema and new destinations. These experiences serve as a wellspring of creativity, expanding my perspectives and fueling my imagination.

Cats hold a special place in my heart, serving as a constant reminder of the importance of balance and mindfulness. During my free time, you'll find me engrossed in captivating books or embarking on exciting adventures to explore diverse cultures and expand my horizons.
 
Gracias totales!
